            Pondy Marina Beach in Pondicherry is the new tourist attraction near the new lighthouse. It was developed under the theme-based beaches programs by the Pondicherry government, and “Pondy Marina” beach is based on a food-based theme.

Pondy Marina Beach is located at Dubrayanpet, 1.5km from the White town, Pondicherry. Unlike the rock beach, where the tourists can hardly venture into the seashores, here, as the name suggests, there is a reasonable length of sandy beach. Pondy Marina offers various food options, such as mangrove forest boating, sandy beaches, river mouth sighting, mangrove forest boating, etc. Pondy Marina is one of the best places to see sunrise in Pondicherry.
