            Eden Beach Pondicherry (Puducherry) is a newly developed beach by the government of Pondicherry compared to other beaches in Pondicherry. The Denmark-based non-profit Foundation has awarded Eden Beach a blue flag tag beach for Environmental Education or FEE.

            Blue Flag beaches are the cleanest beaches globally, eco-friendly, and have all the amenities tourists need. In India, only ten beaches are given the Blue flag Tag; Eden Beach in Pondicherry is one of them. So, getting the blue tag for Eden Beach is a proud moment for the Pondicherry people.
